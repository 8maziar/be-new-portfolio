## Description
Portfolio Project

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
- Add `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test` environment variables to the `.env.test` and `PGDATABASE=nc_news` to `.env.development` file.

**Note**: Since the `.env` file is not included in the repository, you'll need to create it manually.

This project includes a `.gitignore` file, which specifies the files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. It is important to keep sensitive or environment-specific files out of version control. The `.gitignore` file ensures that the `.env` file, containing sensitive information, is not accidentally committed and shared publicly.
